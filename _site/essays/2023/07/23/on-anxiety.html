    <p>There it’s done. First words finally written with the intention of being published.</p>

<p>Apparently, it takes more than just a couple of words. Perhaps it’ll be several articles before I feel comfortable writing.</p>

<p>I already hate the meta tone this is taking. But let’s just get something written and we will see where it takes us.</p>

<p>Okay, so on anxiety. I feel a powerful urge to create. I think for my entire life, but most definitively around around the age of 22. Prior to that, I think it was there but not a <strong>drive</strong>. I just wasn’t compelled to learn to draw or play an instrument or take photos.</p>

<p>That changed. No reason to get into why but it was there and I lacked the language to express it. At multiple levels. I couldn’t articulate it (still can’t well). I couldn’t express it since everything I was creating was failing to impress me. So I didn’t do much since I was tired of finding things not as I had them in my head.</p>

<p>And the things in my head, were not impressing me either.</p>

<p>The root of my anxiety largely comes from this mismatch. I had an urge to create but no means of expressing that feeling, <em>in a way that was adequate to me</em>. In a way that was exceptional to me.</p>

<p>This is a familiar catch 22 to people who create, I believe. It’s been addressed in a number of media<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and this feeling is shared<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. The only way to get better is to create. But you have to be vulnerable to do that. And to the hardest audience, yourself.</p>

<p>Often times, I imagined that the things I would create are would be for others. I think that’s fine. But I don’t think it’ll end up as authentic if the thing you’re creating is intended to be artistic. It can certainly end up skilled and impressive.  But that’s the goal. To seem skilled and impressive to other people.</p>

<p>I’ve found it exceptionally hard to create things that seem skilled and impressive to me. One because I am unskilled at creating things. And two, I don’t know what that looks like.</p>

<p>An anxiety of not being good enough to express who I am. An anxiety of being good enough to express who I am and still finding it lacking. An anxiety of wasted years. An anxiety of being known. An anxiety of being understood.</p>

<p>The antidote for all of this is simple. Create things you like.</p>
